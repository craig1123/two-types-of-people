## Getting Started

* `yarn` to install all the dependencies
* `yarn build` This will create a 'build' folder containing JS and CSS bundled files.
* `yarn start` This will start a local development server on port 3000.

### The Tech

We are using `firebase` for the database which stores gender, ageGroup, US state, and the options people have selected. You will need to make a `keys.js` file in the `config` folder and contact Craig Walker for the secrets.

`localStorage` is used to save people's session and where they're at in the quiz/if they've already taken it.

`React/Redux/React-router` for UI, state management and routing

This is a Progressive web app and registers a service-worker
